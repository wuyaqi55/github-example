    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "Madison, the capital city of Wisconsin, lies west of Milwaukee. It’s known for the domed Wisconsin State Capitol, which sits on an isthmus between lakes Mendota and Monona. As of July 1, 2018, Madison's estimated population of 258,054 made it the second-largest city in Wisconsin by population, after Milwaukee, and the 81st-largest in the United States. Located on an isthmus and lands surrounding four lakes-Lake Mendota, Lake Monona, Lake Kegonsa and Lake Waubesa-the city is home to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the Wisconsin State Capitol, Henry Vilas Zoo, lakes, and an extensive network of parks and bike trails. The presence of the University of Wisconsin–Madison (the largest employer in the state) as well as other educational institutions has a significant impact on the economy, culture, and demographics of Madison. Madison is a growing technology economy and the region is home to the headquarters of Epic Systems, American Family Insurance, Exact Sciences, Promega, American Girl, Sub-Zero, Lands' End, a regional office for Google, the University Research Park, as well as many biotech and health systems startups. So many education and science institutes and large companies in Madison, which means a hurge demand of food. Then, there is a good business chance to invest a restaurant here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem\n",
    "To invest a restaurant, we need to define the restaurants and its content, like what kind of restaurants to start. Also, the location of the restaurant is very important. In this project we will explore the restaurants at Madison, WI. area, and using current restaurants information to figure out what kind of restaurants to start and which locations is the good choice for him. \n",

    "### 1.3 Insterest\n",
    "As a restaurant invester who wants to start a restaurant in Madison, WI area, he/she would be insterets in what kind of restaurant he want to start and where to locate his restaurant. "

    "## 2. Data acquisition and cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data Source\n",
    "Foursquare location data will be used in this project to analysis the style and location of the new restaurant.  The surrounding restaurants data can be got from Foursquare API by using request function by passing url which is the path to access the data we need. The url will be like 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search?client_id={}&client_secret={}&ll={},{}&v={}&query={}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(\n",
    "    CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, latitude, longitude, VERSION, search_query, radius, LIMIT)\", in which (latitude, longitude) is the geographical coordinate of city Madison, which can be got through the \"arcgisThe\" function in geocoder package by passing 'Madison, WI'. And CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET are the username and passwords to access to Foursquare location data. The key word 'restaurant' is passed as the search_query. I would like to set the version, radius, LIMIT as '20200309', '1000' and '100' respectively. To be able to do deep analysis, the rating score of the restaurants were also extract from Foursquare location data and will be combined into restaurants data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data cleaning\n",
    "Madison restaurants data will download from Foursquare as the description above. Then, we can get  json data of the surrounding restaurants, which contains unreadable data and some codes. To make the data readable, the json data will be transfered into normal data by using the json_normalize() function, then basic information of restaurant will be extract from the dataframe, like names, id, geographical coordinate, category, address, Zip Code, rating, etc., to form a new clean data frame. I removed the restaurants which don't have the ranting score, since rating score is a important criteria to choose the type and location of a new restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Feature selection \n",
    "After cleaning the data set, the table of restaurants data contains 'name', 'categories', 'address', 'cc', 'city', 'country', 'crossStreet', 'distance', 'formattedAddress', 'labeledLatLngs', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'neighborhood', 'postalCode', 'state', 'id', 'rating'. But apparently there are some duplicate information of the restaurants, like city, state, contry, etc.. To make the data analysis more easier and clear, I will choose restaurant name, category, latitude, longitude and rating as the columns.  "
